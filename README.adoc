This is a `Dockerfile` and a wrapper script called `snapcraft-docker` which
helped me build my https://github.com/uroesch/snap-asciidoctor[first snap].

NOTE: The code and instructions are provided as is.

[[docker-build]]
== Docker Build
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker pull snapcore/snapcraft
git clone https://github.com/uroesch/snapcraft-docker.git
cd snapcraft-docker
sudo docker build -t snapcore/snapcraft:custom .
----

NOTE: To make the container work for your environment you may need
 to set the environment variable `BUILD_USER_ID` to your own `UID`
 before running `docker build`. The default `UID` is `1000`.

[[usage]]
== Building a Snap with `snapcraft-docker` 
[source,bash]
----
cd mysnap
snapcraft-docker
----

NOTE: The above example assumes you have copied the `snapcraft-docker`
  script into a directory referenced in your `PATH`.
